Summary:
This project used the d3.js library to build a boxplot visualization. The data is subseted using R to select the interest 

features and output the dataset file "loandata.csv". The data is read using script written in the index.html 
The boxplot is aim to demonstrate the relation between different variable to answer the question that what factor affect 

the loan amount and who borrow the most.
In general, the loan amount is increase with income range, though the $0 group is a special one, which has a larger 

median than $1-24,999 group. It is interesting as it shows that sometime not the richer one will borrow more.
Home Owner is another variable that added into the visualization, in all income range group, home owner borrows more 

than non- home owner.

Design
A box plot is build to show the distribution of loan amount in different subset of variable. Peopple can click the button to 

see loan amount in home owner group in different income range or non- home owner.
